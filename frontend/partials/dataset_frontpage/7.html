			Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving (JAAD) is a new dataset for studying joint attention in the context of autonomous driving. In particular, the focus is on pedestrian and driver behaviors at the point of crossing and factors that influence them. To this end, JAAD dataset provides an annotated collection of short video clips representing scenes typical for everyday urban driving in various weather conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			JAAD dataset contains 346 high-resolution video clips (most are 5-10 sec) extracted from approx. 240 hours of driving videos filmed in several locations in North America and Eastern Europe.
